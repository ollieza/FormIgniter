FormIgniter v0.8 - http://formigniter.org - running on CI 2.0 Reactor
========================================================================

Formigniter takes away the drudge work of building your forms. You can now go
on to build the more interesting custom elements, session controls and data manipulation.

INSTALL
-------

Copy the controller, view, models, libraries into your application directory of a CodeIgniter installation

Writting forms to files
-----------------------

If you want your built forms to be written to files please CHMOD the directory /forms at the base of the install.

Save statistics to a database
------------------------------

If you want to save a count of the number of forms built import the database schema from ./schema.sql

Change the constant DB in ./controllers/formigniter.php to TRUE.
